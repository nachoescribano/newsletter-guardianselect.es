                    As promised in the past Webinar on Regulations, Guardian Select launches the new UK Building Regulations & Glass Reference Guide. This document is an informative brochure on the UK Building Regulations concerning glass. Doc L (Conservation of fuel and power), Doc O (Overheating), and Doc Q Security in Dwellings are the 3 documents highlighted since they contain specific standards to abide by when it comes to glass. We are sure it will be a very useful tool for you. You can download it <a class="link-anchor" href="https://mcusercontent.com/c0345e9000cacc51ee17c5d30/files/fb3ada8f-8341-156b-e33d-085010731268/4046_guide_uk_building_regulations_amp_glass_v.260224_screen.pdf">here</a>, print it and distribute among your customers. Remember that it is also available in the <a class="link-footer" href="https://www.guardianglass.com/gb/en/tools-and-resources/resources/resource-hub">Resource Hub</a>.

                    Guardian's SatinDeco® is a translucent, satin glass that also has a high level of natural light transmission. This not only allows plenty of light to pass through, but gently diffuses it to create environments that appear to glow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The uniform etching of SatinDeco® also helps make marks such as fingerprints less visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can configure it in our Guardian Glass Analytics, select the desired position and click on “Guardian Europe Residential” and change it to “Type: Textured surface” below select “Guardian SatinDeco®” and click accept.
